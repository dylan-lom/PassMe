<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>To use the Beta release of PassMe, you&rsquo;ll need the <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> extension installed, an account and some ether on the <a href="https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/">Kovan Test Network</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a video walkthrough of the process on <a href="https://youtu.be/_7TEOEa1Ly8">YouTube</a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install MetaMask for your browser.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn">Chrome Webstore</a><br/>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/">Firefox Addons</a><br/>
<a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/metamask/">Opera Addons</a><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension">Source</a></p></blockquote></li>

<li><p>When you installed the extension it should have opened a new tab, follow the instructions in that tab to create a new account for ethereum transactions.</p></li>

<li><p>Switch networks to the Kovan Test Network, as shown below</p>

<p> <img src="../pub/start-networks.gif" alt="Switching Networks GIF" /></p></li>

<li><p>Access the <a href="https://faucet.kovan.network/">Kovan Faucet</a>, to redeem 1ETH for your account.
       This process requires a Github account, to authenticate you, and your newly created account's address,
       which will be copied to your clipboard when you click on your account's name at the top of the metamask
       extension</p></li>

<li><p>Visit the <a href="../demos/web/">PassMe web application</a>, when prompted for the &lsquo;contract address&rsquo;, insert the value below (begging with 0x), which is where the
PassMe contract is deployed on the Kovan test network.</p>

  <blockquote><p><strong>0xa2BeF77575CBc0a1580A792479e8AcA321870d57</strong></p></blockquote></li>

<li><p>Enter a master-password when prompted, this will be used to derive a secure key for encrypting your passwords. Your master password should be at least 12 characters long, and include
  a variety of letters, numbers and symbols. You should make your master password as random as possible (you can write it down on some paper if needed). Random passwords can be generated <a href="https://www.avast.com/random-password-generator">here</a></p></li>

<li><p>The first time you use PassMe, it will prompt you for an initial transaction. <strong>This is required to initialise
  your vault on the blockchain, please accept the transaction</strong>, otherwise you may encounter issues when attempting to interact with
your stored passwords. After you've confirmed this, please reload the page and re-enter the contract address and your master password</p></li>
<li><p>After you've reloaded the page, and entered your master-password once more, you'll be met with the 'Retrieve a Password' screen, but at the moment there won't be anything saved to your
	vault, to add something click on the grey 'Save a pasword' navigation button, enter the site's URL and password and submit. After this you'll be prompted by Metamask to confirm the
	transaction. It may take a few seconds for the transaction to be validated and added to a block, so please be patient and wait until MetaMask indicates that the transaction has been
	confirmed.</p></li>

<li><p>After your password has been saved, you need to refresh your local vault by clicking the 'update vault' navigation button. Now you'll find you password once you search for it in the URL
	input. The icons in the 'Actions' column are as follows: <br>
	Eye: toggle the visibility of the sites password<br>
	Bin: permanently delete this password, this is a transaction that will cost about the same as writing a new note.</p></li>
