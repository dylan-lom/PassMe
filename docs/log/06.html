  <h1>Extension Testing Cont.</h1>
  I&rsquo;m getting much more comfortable with how chrome extensions are supposed to be written, here is an example &lsquo;rule&rsquo; â€” which is used to enable the popup when the &lsquo;conditions&rsquo; are met:</p>

<pre><code>
var RuleHasPass = {
    conditions: [
        new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({ //match page for conditions, 
            //pageUrl: {hostEquals: 'some url'}, //for host matching
            css: ["input[type='password']"] //check DOM has an input of type="password"
        })
    ],
    actions: [
        new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowPageAction() //enable popup
    ]
};
</code></pre>


<p>For my project I&rsquo;ll need to check from three rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the url already saved? In which case we should display the 'load password' dialogue (actions:[browser.action.setPopup(...)])</li>
<li>Is the url not saved (ie. !RuleSavedHost) but has password? display the 'saved password' dialogue</li>
<li>else... display the 'manual save' dialogue</li>
</ul>

<p>Other issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>git doesn't work through school proxy (need to use the web UI -- which is a pain because you can't <code>git add .</code> without uploading every file)</li>
<li>i was lazy and didn't name commits -- you can't ammend commit messages from the WebUI</li>
</ul>
