<p> It's currently a little past halfway through January Holidays -- unsuprisingly I didn't keep up with my gantt schedule over the last few weeks.</p>
<ul>
	<li>So far I haven't done any real work on my project in the holidays.</li>
	<li>I've done about half of the standards algoriths (see <a href="https://github.com/dylan-lom/standard-algorithms">github</a>).</li>
	<li>I attempted to set up a local TRON testnet, however the documentation confused me and I ran into some errors compiling.</li>
	<li>However, since the TVM is backwards compatable with EVM, it means that I can begin working on a local Ethereum network and figure out the TRON problems later.</li>
	<li>I followed this <a href="https://medium.com/cybermiles/running-a-quick-ethereum-private-network-for-experimentation-and-testing-6b1c23605bce">guide</a> and have a local Ethereum/Geth instance running.<img src="pub/01-eth.png" alt="eth"/><em>Left: </em>Geth js console, showing current balance, local accounts and mining status. <em>Right:</em> Output from local node (currently mining).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I need to continue learning solidity and begin writing some function stubs for my program.</p>
