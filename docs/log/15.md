# 15 - Submission (v0.6)

Submission date is almost upon me, I've scrapped the idea for a chrome extension.

I had originally hoped that the process of migrating from `node -> web -> extension` would be
 simple, and for the first step, it relatively was. However, in order to get MetaMask to funciton
 in combination with an extension, there are two suggested approaches:

 1. [Call upon the MetaMask extension from within another extension through Chrome's
  `runtime.connect` functionality](https://medium.com/@writeprovidence/how-to-create-a-web3-provider-from-another-extension-6b5ea59ed4c9). This was quickly ruled out as when I compiled the source
  code from GitHub (for the metamask-extension repo), there was no port-stream.js file created, and
  this method seemed fragile, since in the ~10 months since the article was written, MetaMask's
  extension id had already changed.

2. [Use mascara](https://github.com/MetaMask/mascara). Metamascara is in an alpha release
 state, and i decided I already depended on enough flakey things in my project (like the
 experiment ABIEncoder I used in the smart contract in order to get string arrays to
 work).

Since neither of these seem appropriate, I decided its a better idea to focus on the web
 application (v0.6), which will be my submission.
