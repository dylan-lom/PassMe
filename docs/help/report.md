12SDD Major Project Report
==========================

Interface Design
----------------

### Target Audience

Since the extension is still in a Beta-testing state, and relys on the evolving Ethereum blockchain, the user-interface and installation process is still targeted at more technical users.

### Ergonomic Issues

Program Development & Techniques
--------------------------------

### Correct Code Generation

### Modularisation of Code

### Effective and Efficient Use of Correct Control Structures

### Effective Use of Appropriate Data Structure

User Documentation
------------------

### Installation Guide

The installation guide is available [here](install.html)

### User Manual / Technical Specifications

Since my project is a chrome extension, with very a simple user interface, there is very little need for a user manual, instead I've written a document about the technical workings of the extension &mdash; relating to the encryption models used in storing and reading passwords from the blockchain, along with other security measures.

The technical specifications document is available [here](technical.html)

### Walkthrough
