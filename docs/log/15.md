# 15 - Submission (v0.6)

Submission date is almost upon me, I've scrapped the idea for a chrome extension.

I had originally hoped that the process of migrating from `node -> web -> extension` would be
 simple, and for the first step, it relatively was. However, in order to get MetaMask to funciton
 in combination with an extension, there are two suggested approaches:

 1. [Call upon the MetaMask extension from within another extension through Chrome's
  `runtime.connect` functionality](https://medium.com/@writeprovidence/how-to-create-a-web3-provider-from-another-extension-6b5ea59ed4c9). This was quickly ruled out as when I compiled the source
  code from GitHub (for the metamask-extension repo), there was no port-stream.js file created, and
  this method seemed fragile, since in the ~10 months since the article was written, MetaMask's
  extension id had already changed.

2. [Use mascara](https://github.com/MetaMask/mascara). Metamascara is in an alpha release
 state, and i decided I already depended on enough flakey things in my project (like the
 experiment ABIEncoder I used in the smart contract in order to get string arrays to
 work).

Since neither of these seem appropriate, I decided its a better idea to focus on the web
 application (v0.6), which will be my submission.

Due to the encroaching deadline, I ended up bodging a couple of solutions. One that I
 had been putting off for a long time was the issue with `onlyOwnerOf`, where the first
 few passwords written would only become readable after a total of 3 or more had been
 added to their 'vault'.

Baffled by what could possibly be causing this, but needing the functionality in order
 to protect users from having malicious others delete their passwords, I bodged in the
 `addFirstPass()` function, which writes two passwords to the start of the user's vault
 with value "1, X, X" (they are considered deleted). I've justified this as an
 initialisation fee, however, this really shouldn't be required.

In solving the 'first pass problem', I also ended up having to add two additional
 modifiers; the `initialized` and `notInitialized` (which check the length of the user's
 vault to see whether they have more than 2 passwds). This works quite well, however it
 frustrates me (and adds an additional gas fee to txn's) that I couldn't flaw the logic
 of the contract.

In re-enabling the `onlyOwnerOf` modifier, I could then enable the `notDeleted` modifier
 (since it was now acceptable to have a `deletePass` function with the `onlyOwnerOf`
  modifier). This makes the whole deleted pass functionality work, however it introduces
  an awful lot of promise rejection errors into the developer console, since MetaMask
  throws an error, since the smart contract rejects all attempts to read deleted notes.

Had I had more time, this could have been tidied up by switching from `.then` callbacks
 to the more sophisticated `.on(event, ...)` callback functionality provided by send
 methods. However, the [documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-send)
 is unclear as to whether this is actually supported by call methods (where no txn is
 being made). For the submission I've left a note in the README file, indicating that
 the 'errors' in the console are completely expected and are actually indications of the
 smart contract operating correctly.

Documentation is boring.

GG Major project.
