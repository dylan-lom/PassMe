<h1>13 - PBKDF2, Encryption and V0.4</h1>

<p>Testing the time taken to hash:</p>

<pre><blockquote><p>pass: &lsquo;mybadpassword1234&rsquo;
salt: &lsquo;0x8babfb24596157203d697e4a6cbcf0406fbe122d&rsquo;
digest: &lsquo;sha512&rsquo;
iterations: Varying
length: 256</p></blockquote></pre>

<p>Note on measurements: the time value is based on linux&rsquo;s time, I have averaged the &lsquo;real&rsquo; output out of 3 run-throughs (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/556405/what-do-real-user-and-sys-mean-in-the-output-of-time1">More info on linux time outputs</a></p>

<p>Graphing this data shows that PBKDF2 is a function where the time taken is linearly related to the number of iterations taken</p>

<p><img src="../pub/13-graph.png"></p>

<p>Obviously, 10<sup>7</sup> passes takes far to long to compute for the derivation function to be user friendly, especially on older hardware (this test was run on an Intel i5-6500 @ 3.20GHz).</p>

<p>Reading over LastPass&rsquo;s <a href="https://assets.cdngetgo.com/60/be/323790b344bf8e631ecb033e4cad/lastpass-technical-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>, they use 100 passes of a PBKDF2 function with iterations set to 100 (ie, 10<sup>4</sup>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m unsure why the pass over the function 100 times, I averaged the difference between running 10<sup>4</sup> iterations vs 10<sup>2</sup> iterations 10<sup>2</sup> times, and found that the second method took .3 seconds long (although an average of 6 passes is probably inadequate for this kind of comparison).</p>

<p><em>Note: In my tests I used the sha512 hashing algorithm, whereas the LastPass paper specifies sha256, so perhaps a performance difference would have been noted had I used that algorithm</em></p>

<p>For the point of safety/convention, I will follow LastPass&rsquo;s example and iterate over the derivation process (this also snags me a required example of control structure for project completeness), and based on my results, I think I would like to take 10<sup>5</sup> passes for my project, since this is when I began to notice the difference in time on my PC (although assuming the PBKDF implementation is sound, the time take <em>should</em> linearly increase).</p>

<h2>AES in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m already using Node to export the Web3 functionality, I can also export Node&rsquo;s <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html">crypto library</a>, which includes PBKDF2, SHA512 and AES-256-CBC implementations, which I can use in PassMe.</p>

<p>I followed <a href="https://lollyrock.com/posts/nodejs-encryption/">this tutorial</a> to get going on how to use the library, then did some experiments to learn a bit more about how the cipher works/the size of the output.</p>

<p>I found that, as long as the user&rsquo;s password length &lt;=31 characters (assuming it&rsquo;s in ASCII, which AFAIK all password forms are), the ciphertext will fit into 32Bytes, which is important as the maximum size of bytes arrays in Solidity is bytes32.</p>

<p>I found this out by playing in an interactive console</p>

<pre><code>
var cipher = Crypto.createCipher('aes256','mypassword');
cipher.update('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa','ascii','hex') //32 a's
//outputs: "fe39592ce8f555211aece0d6bfdfb7bcacbe8c20ae6c48bb69a30117d4314023" (this output is already 32B, and would max out the bytes32 object when stored on the blockchain, so we will excluded cipher.final('hex'))
var decipher = Crypto.createDecipher('aes256','mypassword');
decipher.update("fe39592ce8f555211aece0d6bfdfb7bcacbe8c20ae6c48bb69a30117d4314023",'hex','ascii');
//outputs: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (16 a's)
decipher.final('ascii');
//outputs: Error: unable to decrypt data
</code></pre>


<p>In this example, because we encrypt 32 characters, it fills all 32B of output ciphertext with the message, without any padding.</p>

<p>For this reason, when we call <code>decipher.final</code>, it cannot determine where the ciphertext should be ending, and errors.</p>

<p>Re-running the above example, but excluding one of the <em>a</em>&rsquo;s, and appending the output of <code>cipher.final('hex')</code> to the input string of decipher, results in <code>decipher.final</code> returning 15 a&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2>Versioning System, and V0.4</h2>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve been working on my project, I&rsquo;ve been trying to version my progress; at the moment I&rsquo;m on version 0.4 (v4)</p>

<p>This is a breakdown of the different versions (preserved in folders in the testing branch):</p>

<p>0.1 &mdash; Learning some basics of Chrome extensions<br/>
0.2 &mdash; More work on chrome extensions<br/>
0.3 &mdash; Putting web3 into a webpage; this is the first release that actually writes some data to the blockchain<br/>
0.4 &mdash; Adding encryption to the webpage<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
0.5 &mdash; Treat the user&rsquo;s passwd array as a vault; on load fetch all passwords and decrypt to local array. This will be the first version deployed to a public testnet.<br/>
0.6 &mdash; Live web version of PassMe<br/>
0.7 &mdash; Chrome extension<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
1.0 &mdash; Deployed on Ethereum mainnet</p>

<h3>Changes in v4</h3>

<p>Accompanying v4, I&rsquo;ve updated PassMe to version 0.2, significantly changing the Pass datastructure:</p>

<blockquote><p>bytes12 href ==> string href
bytes32 pass ==> string pass</p></blockquote>

<p>This was necessary due to the large size of hashed passwords; leaving the pass data types as <code>bytes32</code> woudld&rsquo;ve hard-capped password length to 15 characters, which isn&rsquo;t really acceptable.</p>

<p>I changed href to string as well, since I decided for added security I should encrypt the url as well.</p>

<p>These changes impact the gas price, and for longer Pass', the user will have to pay additional gas.</p>

<p>This transaction, for example, cost 0.000545 ETH (approximately $0.25 AUD)</p>

<p><img src="../pub/13-passme.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still one final bug in v4 before I move on; for some reason, when I try to read the pass with between 1-2 passwords written, I get an RPC error, however when I write additional passwords I can read these earlier passwords just fine.</p>

<h2>Public Geth Network</h2>

<p>I was hoping that I&rsquo;d be able to set up a publicly accessable testnet, which I could leave the contract deployed on so that it would be easier to get people to test my project, however I can&rsquo;t seem to expose the network publicly.</p>

<p>I initially tried to expose a <code>geth</code> instance, changing the address that it&rsquo;s deployed at from localhost => 127.0.0.1, but that didn&rsquo;t seem to work (I couldn&rsquo;t get MetaMask to connect)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some documentation about using <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster">bootnodes</a>, however I couldn&rsquo;t get this to work.</p>

<p>This is a little frustrating because it means I&rsquo;ll need to set up the contract on a testnet + create an account on the net for people in order to get user feedback.</p>
