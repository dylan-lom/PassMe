<h2 id="1">1 Overview of Operation</h2>


<p>The PassMe program uses the decentralised <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> blockchain as a secure storage location for a user&rsquo;s
 encrypted passwords.</p>

<p>When the application is initially launched, the user is asked to connect their Ethereum address, and enter a master password. Once this
 information is provided, the program fetches their AES encrypted passwords (vault) from the blockchain and decrypts their information
 via a derived master key. <em>The terminology of a vault is used in the context of other password managers, and although implementation
 details vary, for this document the array of user&rsquo;s passwords stored on the blockchain will be referred to as a vault.</em></p>

<h2 id="2">2 PassMe Smart Contract</h2>


<p>The following security mechanisms operate on the principle that the Ethereum blockchain acts as an immutable, permanent storage space.</p>

<p>Inbuilt into the contract is address authentication, to confirm that the contract only has access to the user&rsquo;s own password vault. This
 is achieved in the <code>onlyOwnerOf</code> modifier, which requires that the address of the message sender matches the address that wrote the
 information originally.</p>

<p>Obviously, however, the information stored in the blockchain is publicly accessable, and any user looking at the blockchain&rsquo;s
 transaction history can match a Ethereum address to the passwords it has stored &amp; read the data they wrote the the blockchain. For that
 reason, the contract doesn&rsquo;t store any further information than the securely encrypted password itself (see <a href="#3">section 3</a>). This
 compromise between security and convinience that was decided necessary to increase the safety of the user&rsquo;s data.</p>

<h3 id="2.1">2.1 Local Encryption</h3>


<p>All encryption/decryption of user data is done on the machine that requests the data &mdash; no hashing in performed in the EVM
 itself, enforcing &ldquo;host-proof&rdquo; security (where the security of a user&rsquo;s information relys on the client&rsquo;s choice of encryption),
 as well as preventing issues that may arise during insecure communications between the user and blockchain.</p>

<p>By default, the master-key, used for the encryption of passwords is derived via the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2 key-derivation function</a>, as described in <a href="#3">section 3</a>.</p>

<p>The local encryption model also means that the user&rsquo;s master-password (and derived key) never leave the user&rsquo;s computer.</p>

<h2 id="3">3 Password Hashing Process</h2>


<p>Following common security practices (a non-technical overview of which can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w68BBPDAWr8">here</a>),
 a user&rsquo;s derived vault key goes through a PBKDF2 SHA-512 hashing process, which recursively hashes a user&rsquo;s master password, salted with
 their Ethereum address to protect user data against brute-force attacks. The purpose of salting the master-key is that it protects the
 user from being vulnerable to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">Rainbow table attack</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s advised that users familiarise themselves with LastPass&rsquo;s security procedures (available <a href="https://assets.cdngetgo.com/60/be/323790b344bf8e631ecb033e4cad/lastpass-technical-whitepaper.pdf">here</a>),
 as it provides a good introduction to the security practices that PassMe applies in applicable areas &mdash; server authentication, for
 example, is not an issue that PassMe is concerned with, as it relies on the Ethereum blockchain&rsquo;s underlying secure authentication
 methods for users.</p>

<h3 id="3.1">3.1 PBKDF2 Master-Key Derivation</h3>


<p>Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 is a <q cite="https://wikipedia.org">key derivation functions with a sliding computational cost,
 used to reduce vulnerabilities to brute force attacks.<q> (wikipedia).</p>

<p>The Master-Key derivation process is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Master-Key = PBKDF2(PRF, Password, Salt, Iterations, Key Length)</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>PRF</em> is a pseudo-random hashing function<br/>
<em>Password</em> is the master password<br/>
<em>Salt</em> consists of unique bits of data to ensure that common master passwords do not produce the same master key<br/>
<em>Iterations</em> is the desired number of iterations to run the <em>PRF</em><br/>
<em>Key Length</em> is the desired length of the derived key</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>For PassMe, this translates into:</p>

<blockquote><p>Master-Key = PBKDF2(SHA-512, Master Password, Account, 100, 256)</p></blockquote>

<p>Which produces a 256 bit key, appropriate for use in the AES256 encryption process used to encrypt passwords.</p>

<p>This master-key derivation process actually runs 100 additional times before the final key is determined (10,000 passes in total)</p>

<h3 id="3.2">3.2 AES-256-CBC Password Encryption</h3>


<p>To encrypt passwords PassMe uses the NodeJS crypto library, which in turn depends on the system SSL library.</p>

<p>PassMe uses Solidity&rsquo;s &lsquo;string&rsquo; data type to store data of any size, however longer passwords will increase the <a href="https://www.ethos.io/what-is-ethereum-gas/">gas</a> required, and it is technically possible to &ldquo;gas out&rdquo; the contract, if the gas required exceeds the maximum gas on the network.</p>

<p>This is unlikely, however, as the mainnet&rsquo;s gas limit is <a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit">quite high</a></p>

<p>The AES Encryption process:</p>

<blockquote><p>aes = createCipher(&lsquo;aes256&rsquo;, Master-Key)
Encrypted-Pass = aes.update(Password, &lsquo;ascii&rsquo;, &lsquo;hex&rsquo;)
Encrypted-Pass += .final(&lsquo;hex&rsquo;)</p></blockquote>

<p>Decryption works in a similar fashion</p>

<blockquote><p>aes-decrypt = createDecipher(&lsquo;aes256&rsquo;, Master-Key)
Password = aes-decrypt.update(Encrypted-Pass, &lsquo;hex&rsquo;, &lsquo;ascii&rsquo;)
Password += aes-decrypt.final(&lsquo;ascii&rsquo;)</p></blockquote>
