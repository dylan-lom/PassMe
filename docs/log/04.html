  <h1>04 - Extension Testing</h1>
  It&rsquo;s been a while&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been focusing on the course work (interrelationship between hardware and software)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started to work on a chrome browser extension[1], but am having trouble installing the web3 library (npm fails, there isn&rsquo;t a ​<code>dist/​node.min.js</code> file provided by the web3 package).  At any rate, here is the test extension, with an icon and a popup.</p>

<p><img src="../04-ext.png" alt="ext.PNG"/></p>

<p>Some notes on chrome extensions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>manifest.json -- declares important info about the extension (name,  files, permissions, etc.)</li>
    <li>background.js -- a controller script, sets up events (e.g.  when a certain page is done, run action)</li>
    <li>popup.html -- a html page that is rendered when the extension is clicked (nb. you can use external css and js, but inline js is not allowed).</li>
</ul>

<p>The approach to getting &ldquo;portable&rdquo; js from the web3 node-js package seems to be as follows</p>

<pre><code>
- download and extract web3 from https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/releases
- in web3 directory run:
    $ npm install .
    $ npm run-script build
which results in populating packages/web3*/dist/ with .js files (noteably not web3.min.js though)
</code></pre>


<p>On further investigation, I&rsquo;ve found a static host of web3.min.js on jsdelivr[2], unfortunately, in recent revisions of web3, there is no longer a web3.js provided[3], and the results from the above npm operations must be packed via webpack[4].</p>

<p>As I don&rsquo;t want to work out how webpack integrates with npm packages, a website, etc. I&rsquo;m going to rely on an outdated version of web3.js hosted by jsdelivr</p>
