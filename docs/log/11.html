<h1>11 - Contract Issues</h1>

<p>I was having a lot of issues communicating with the NoteChain contract, specifically running createNote().</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a new <a href="https://github.com/dylan-lom/PassMe/tree/testing">testing branch</a>, and my own Smart Contract (PassMe.sol), to test with &mdash; I&rsquo;ve been thinking more critically about how much excess functionality the NoteChain contract needs, and thought it&rsquo;d be better to just create a new one with only what I need (ie. no public keys/public reading functions).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been recieving this error (or similar), when I try to run addPass (the same as createNote, except without public key argument)</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dylan-lom/ef4bcb6bb00a6335e190841f3a798715.js"></script>


<p>MetaMask is able to detect this error before execution, as when I go to accept the transaction it warns:</p>

<p>Troubleshooting I&rsquo;ve tried:
* removing the payFee modifier
* creating the <code>addPass</code> function/removing the public key
* removing the assigning of an owner to the key (via the passToOwner mapping)
* removing the .push'ing to the ownerPasswds array
* removing the <code>emit PassAdded</code>
* changing type of arguments <code>_href</code> (<code>_title</code>) and <code>_pass</code> (<code>_content</code>) to string (from bytesX)</p>

<p>The issue was that I wasn&rsquo;t supplying a <code>value: x</code> option in <code>.send({...})</code>, which lead to the failure of contract execution. Which I caught when I ran across the amusingly titled <a href="https://vmexceptionwhileprocessingtransactionrevert.com/">VM Exception while processing transaction: Revert</a> page.</p>

<p>Now I can happily run <code>addPass</code> as so:</p>

<pre><code>contract.methods.addPass(0, \_web3.utils.asciiToHex('href',12), \_web3.utils.asciiToHex('password', 32)).send({from: acc, value: \_web3.utils.toWei('0.0002')});</code></pre>


<p>However, I still get the error when calling <code>getPass</code>: <code>MetaMask - RPC Error: Internal JSON-RPC error. Object { code: -32603, message: "Internal JSON-RPC error." }</code></p>

<p>One concern that I&rsquo;ve had is the actually implementation details of a chrome extension that inherently relies on another extension (MetaMask).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the interaction between the two will be when my extension causes a popup from MetaMask? I think this might cause some issues with my extension&rsquo;s function.</p>

<p>One nice thing about the HTML nature of the extension is that it should be fairly trivial to first develop a standalone webpage, and then attempt to port it to a chrome extension (simply by including a <code>manifest.json</code>, which Chrome interprets to create an extension in the browser).</p>

<p>On another note, one of the upsides to using the NoteChain contract is that it&rsquo;s <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xD4737858Dd8eb9842CD0696171b781525B56086f">already deployed on the mainnet</a>, meaning that if someone wants to actually use my project they can (whereas I don&rsquo;t currently own any ETH, meaning that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to deploy my contract to the mainnet).</p>

<h2>Other Changes/Issues</h2>

<p>The following additional changes have been made to my test page (v3 in the testing branch)
* Set <code>_web3.eth.defaultAccount</code>, instead of saving a global variable acc; defaultAccount is used for the <code>from:</code> field automatically, when none is supplied.
* Added the alias function <code>getPassCount</code> (js), which evokes the contract method of the same name, and returns the output, converted hex=>number</p>

<p>The following issues were encountered:
* The first time a tab calls <code>ethereum.enable()</code>, it is async, but all of the following times it isn&rsquo;t and including an await statement causes an error, I&rsquo;m not really sure how to fix this, since I would need some sort of initialisation page that had an await, and then the actual interactive page wouldn&rsquo;t?</p>
