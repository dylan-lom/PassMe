  <h1>04 - Extension Testing</h1>
  It's been a while... I've been focusing on the course work (interrelationship between hardware and software)

I've started to work on a chrome browser extension[1], but am having trouble installing the web3 library (npm fails, there isn't a ​`dist/​node.min.js` file provided by the web3 package).  At any rate, here is the test extension, with an icon and a popup.

Some notes on chrome extensions:
<ul>
	<li>manifest.json -- declares important info about the extension (name,  files, permissions, etc.)</li>
	<li>background.js -- a controller script, sets up events (e.g.  when a certain page is done, run action)</li>
	<li>popup.html -- a html page that is rendered when the extension is clicked (nb. you can use external css and js, but inline js is not allowed).</li>
</ul>

The approach to getting "portable" js from the web3 node-js package seems to be as follows
<pre><code>
- download and extract web3 from https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/releases
- in web3 directory run:
	$ npm install .
	$ npm run-script build
which results in populating packages/web3*/dist/ with .js files (noteably not web3.min.js though)
 </pre></coode>

On further investigation, I've found a static host of web3.min.js on jsdelivr[2], unfortunately, in recent revisions of web3, there is no longer a web3.js provided[3], and the results from the above npm operations must be packed via webpack[4].

As I don't want to work out how webpack integrates with npm packages, a website, etc. I'm going to rely on an outdated version of web3.js hosted by jsdelivr
