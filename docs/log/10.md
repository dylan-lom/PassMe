Feeling better about using Webpack, I've tried working with the NoteChain contract, adopting the deployment used in [this tutorial](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-and-web3-js-141115b0f8c5)

So far I've just been working with the Node interactive console (invoked via <code>$ node</code>)

In order to test the NoteChain contract, we need to authenticate our account via web3.eth.accounts, we can do this via:

<code>web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privKey)</code>

Which imports a single account from the private key (output when starting ganache-cli), the method returns an [account object](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#eth-accounts-create-return).

Then, when we want to send a txn to the blockchain, we can run 

<code>contract.modules.myFunc().send({from: myAccount}).then(...)</code>

Frustratingly, when testing this, I recieved the following error:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dylan-lom/84999313eb496ce00890b2bd5b41c2a1.js"></script>

Unfortunately, because Web3 v1.00 is still in beta, there isn't a wide userbase, and this issue doesn't seem to have been encountered much, I found the following results when searching on Google:

* [TypeError: Duplicated method __ob__. This method is defined as RPC call and as Object method.](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/2281) &mdash; this relates to specifically to Vue.js, and the solution seems to be reverting to an earlier version of Web3
* [Contract Methods Undefined](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/63548/contract-methods-undefined) &mdash; seems to have been an issue with how the user was creating their Contract instance, this hasn't worked for me
* [TypeError: Duplicated method getAccounts. This method is defined as RPC call and as Object method.](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/2344) &mdash; no solution

My next attempt might be to try Webpacking a test, and testing in the browser console with injected Web3 from MetaMask, although one of the SO comments seemed to indicate MetaMask still uses a pre-1.00 release of Web3.

I'll also have a look over what the [NoteChain frontend](https://gitlab.com/notechain/front-end-generator) (used by notechain.github.io) does to create the contract.
