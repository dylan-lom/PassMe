  <h1>Extension Testing Cont.</h1>
  I'm getting much more comfortable with how chrome extensions are supposed to be written, here is an example 'rule' â€” which is used to enable the popup when the 'conditions' are met:
<pre><code>
var RuleHasPass = {
	conditions: [
		new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({ //match page for conditions, 
			//pageUrl: {hostEquals: 'some url'}, //for host matching
			css: ["input[type='password']"] //check DOM has an input of type="password"
		})
	],
	actions: [
		new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowPageAction() //enable popup
	]
};
</code></pre>

For my project I'll need to check from three rules:
<ul>
<li>Is the url already saved? In which case we should display the 'load password' dialogue (actions:[browser.action.setPopup(...)])</li>
<li>Is the url not saved (ie. !RuleSavedHost) but has password? display the 'saved password' dialogue</li>
<li>else... display the 'manual save' dialogue</li>
</ul>

Other issues: 
<ul>
<li>git doesn't work through school proxy (need to use the web UI -- which is a pain because you can't <code>git add .</code> without uploading every file)</li>
<li>i was lazy and didn't name commits -- you can't ammend commit messages from the WebUI</li>
</ul>
