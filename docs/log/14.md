# 14 - v0.5 and MetaMask for extensions

I've almost finished v5, all that's left is to work out
 toggleable password fields in search results, and taking
 advantage of the MetaData field.

So far I haven't discussed the reason why I kept this field
 from NoteChain, but the reason it was used there was to
 counterract the blockchain's immutability; by setting metadata
 to 1 in the original contract, you marked that the note had been
 'deleted'.

For PassMe, I'll retain the 1==deleted approach, but also since
 the project is still unreleased, I'd like to start using it to
 identify which version of PassMe wrote the note, e.g.
 for the current version of the PassMe contract (v0.3.5), I'll
 set metadata to '0'.

Later iterations can use >1

Anyway, here's a demo using the search function that I wrote
