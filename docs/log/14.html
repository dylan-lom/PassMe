<h1>14 - v0.5 and Password Visibility</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve almost finished v5, all that&rsquo;s left is to work out
 toggleable password fields in search results, and taking
 advantage of the MetaData field.</p>

<p>So far I haven&rsquo;t discussed the reason why I kept this field
 from NoteChain, but the reason it was used there was to
 counterract the blockchain&rsquo;s immutability; by setting metadata
 to 1 in the original contract, you marked that the note had been
 &lsquo;deleted&rsquo;.</p>

<p>For PassMe, I&rsquo;ll retain the 1==deleted approach, but also since
 the project is still unreleased, I&rsquo;d like to start using it to
 identify which version of PassMe wrote the note, e.g.
 for the current version of the PassMe contract (v0.3.5), I&rsquo;ll
 set metadata to &lsquo;0&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Frontends that wanted to use different encryption models, for example, could use >1</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a demo using the search function that I wrote</p>

<p><img src="../pub/14-search.gif" alt="Search Demo" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of issues with the toggle buttons, since it&rsquo;s important to be able
 to address the created password elements by id (to use the
 <code>document.getElementById(...)</code> method, in order to modify their contents via a function).
I kept recieving a <code>document.getElementById(...) is undefined</code> error, which I couldn&rsquo;t
 work out the root of, so I ended up sticking a lot of <code>console.log()</code> output statements
 throughout the module in order to try and pin down why I couldn&rsquo;t find the id. At the
 time of writing, the issue still alludes me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to use icons to indicate the visibility toggle button, and I could use the
 common iconography of an open eye to indicate toggling the visibility to readable, and
 an eye with a line through it to indicate toggling visibility to hidden.</p>

<p>Common icons are available under the Apache open source license from Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline">Material
 Design project</a>, as well as on
 wikicommons (i believe these are all public domain, although a citation is needed).</p>

<p>One issue with toggleable visibility is the actual hidden state of the text, since
 HTML paragraph elements don&rsquo;t have a password display mode like inputs do, solutions
 to this could be to create an input that users couldn&rsquo;t edit, or to roll-my-own function
 which converts text into &lsquo;*&rsquo; characters, although then I&rsquo;d also need to implement a
 data structure that could store the real password when it&rsquo;s in its &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; state.</p>
