12SDD Major Project Report
==========================

Interface Design
----------------

### Target Audience

Since the extension is still in a Beta-testing state, and relys on the evolving Ethereum blockchain, the user-interface and installation process is still targeted at more technical users.

The interface remains relatively simple, as there isn't much interaction required.

Early prototypes had several 'modes' of operation, which allowed for the user to either

* Click an autofill button
* Manually fetch a site's password to the clipboard
* Automatically add a site's details
* Manually add a site's details

However, I have chosen simplicity of operation over these features, due to the project's early stages in development.

I can later add such features based on user feedback if requested.

### Ergonomic Issues

Since the application is a chrome extension, which uses web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), ataining consistancy in the design was achieved through CSS styling of HTML elements, which can be re-used consistantly.

The interface itself is a simple and monochromatic, giving it a clean and uniform appearance. I chose the Verdana font, since it is ubiquitos and readable.

I followed the HTML5 specifications and implemented elements for their designed purposes (e.g. a button to autofill), and followed conventions in Web development, like embedding JavaScript files, rather than writing in-line with script elements.


Program Development & Techniques
--------------------------------

### Correct Code Generation

### Modularisation of Code

### Effective and Efficient Use of Correct Control Structures

### Effective Use of Appropriate Data Structure

User Documentation
------------------

### Installation Guide

The installation guide is available [here](install.html)

### User Manual / Technical Specifications

Since my project is a chrome extension, with very a simple user interface, there is very little need for a user manual, instead I've written a document about the technical workings of the extension &mdash; relating to the encryption models used in storing and reading passwords from the blockchain, along with other security measures.

The technical specifications document is available [here](technical.html)
