# 12 - Almost there

The solution to the problem with calling the `getPass(int _id)` method was, like the `addPass(...)` method to do with the options passed in call/send.

Looking at the [NoteChain front-end-generator](https://gitlab.com/notechain/front-end-generator), I found in contract.js that he sets `gasPrice = Math.pow(10,9)` (Math.pow is exponentiation, call equates to 10^9), and MetaMask informs me that I need at least 21000 gas to perform the transaction.

I'm not exactly sure why though, as on the mainnet deployment you don't need to pay to read a note, this might have something to do with the contract's value (as reported by Etherscan as Vale: $1.02/Balance: 0.0038 Ether) &mdash; I'll have to look into this further.

The returned value is Hexadecimal, padding with 0's, which we can convert to ASCII with `_web3.utils.hexToAscii(hexValue)`, this returns the value, and all padded 0's (which were added when we converted the string into a bytesX object of X length.
