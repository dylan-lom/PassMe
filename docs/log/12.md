# 12 - Almost there

The solution to the problem with calling the `getPass(int _id)` method was, like the `addPass(...)` method to do with the options passed in call/send.

Looking at the [NoteChain front-end-generator](https://gitlab.com/notechain/front-end-generator), I found in contract.js that he sets `gasPrice = Math.pow(10,9)` (Math.pow is exponentiation, call equates to 10^9), and MetaMask informs me that I need at least 21000 gas to perform the transaction.

I'm not exactly sure why though, as on the mainnet deployment you don't need to pay to read a note, this might have something to do with the contract's value (as reported by Etherscan as Vale: $1.02/Balance: 0.0038 Ether) &mdash; I'll have to look into this further.

The returned value is Hexadecimal, padding with 0's, which we can convert to ASCII with `_web3.utils.hexToAscii(hexValue)`, this returns the value, and all padded 0's (which were added when we converted the string into a bytesX object of X length.

## Looking Good

Setting the default [gas and gasPrice](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-shh.html#web3-module-defaultgasprice), means that we getPass runs without a problem, and we don't have to pay

`hexToAscii()` also strips trailing blank characters automatically as well, so that's something else that I don't need to worry about

Things I still need to do

* Encrypt passwords
* Work out communications with the [MetaMask extension](https://medium.com/@writeprovidence/how-to-create-a-web3-provider-from-another-extension-6b5ea59ed4c9)
* [Host a live testnet](https://medium.com/coinmonks/ethereum-setting-up-a-private-blockchain-67bbb96cf4f1), which I can host a copy of the contract on, which the Beta release of the extension can use for distribution
* Write webpage autofilling function
* Technical documentation
* Other documentation...
