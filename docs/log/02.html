  <h1>02 - Slow Going</h1>
  Minimal progress has been made on my project, I didn&rsquo;t end up doing any further work on it in the holidays.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This week as an exercise, we wrote up a standard algorithm (FindDaysandMonths) in the language we would be using for our major projects.</li>
    <li>From this I discovered that solidity isn't suited for string manipulation, become a little more comfortable with the remix IDE and wrote a piece of JS code that could interact with the output of my solidity contract [1]</li>
    <li>I still haven't tried compiling and running my .sol contract on a local testnet (I just used the IDE's Run functionality to test), and so I haven't worked out how to directly interact with the contract via the web3.js library</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>js to format output as per standard algorithms spec.</em></p>


<p>On reflecting, I think it would be a good idea to first write the browser extension for the existing NoteChain contract [2], and then after becoming more familiar with solidity and understanding how NoteChain&rsquo;s contract works I could begin to develop my own contract.</p>

<p>I also think it&rsquo;s a good idea to be backwards-compatible with the existing NoteChain contract (as chances are my contract will be far less efficient).</p>
